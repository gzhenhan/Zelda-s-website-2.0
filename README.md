# Zelda's website 2.0

Welcome to the repository for my individual project Zelda's website 2.0.

## Getting started

Navigate to the "zelda's-website-2.0" directory
First enter `npm install` in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies, then enter `npm run dev` to start the development server. The terminal will show you which port the project is running on (most likely 5173). Enter `http://localhost:{PORT}` in a browser of your choice and feel free to navigate around and interact with the website.

Some packages I've used that you may need to install

- npm install react-router-dom
- npm i react-responsive-masonry
- npm i react-calendar
- npm i react-vertical-timeline-component
- npm i react-wandering-pet

## Support

Here are links to official websites and additional resources.

- [React](https://react.dev/): the most popular frontend framework. Here's a great, full-length [tutorial](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).
- [Packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/package): i've used this to search for some interesting packages that could be used in this site.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): a build tool to quickly set up React (and other) projects.

## Website status

Currently updating the About page with information about Zelda's owner (aka me)!
